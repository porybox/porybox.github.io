# Extracting Pokémon from your game

To upload and display a Pokémon on Porybox, you need to extract its information from your game. This information is stored as a pk6 (for generation 6 games) or pk7 (for generation 7 games). These are simply small files that contain all the data related to your Pokémon. You can upload the Pokémon files to Porybox individually, or you can upload an entire decrypted save file and Porybox will extract all of the Pokémon on its own.

There are several ways to obtain Pokémon files from your games. Some require extra hardware or a console with a specific firmware version. Others require nothing more than an SD card reader.

## X, Y, Alpha Sapphire, Omega Ruby

The most common methods for obtaining the pk6 files of your Pokémon are:  

*   Reading Battle Videos
*   Running homebrew applications: svdt or JK’s Save Manager
*   Reading save files through KeySAV2 (Windows) or KeySAVe (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)
*   Using PowerSaves through the keystream method

Here is a handy table that lists the requirement for each of the methods above:
