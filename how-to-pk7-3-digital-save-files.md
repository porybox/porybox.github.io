# Method 3: Digital save files

## Initial breaking

You will only have to complete these steps once.

1.  Catch or breed six Pokémon. They have to originate from the game you wish to check shiny values on.
2.  Put them into the first row of the first box in your computer.
3.  Save the game.
4.  Soft reset (`L` + `R` + `Select`).
5.  Save the game again.
6.  Exit the game.
7.  Use either an SD Card reader or the MicroSD Management option to access your SD card. Navigate to this folder on your SD card:
    *   If you have Sun, go to `Nintendo 3DS\x\x\title\00040000\00164800\data` (`x` being random letters/numbers).
    *   If you have Moon, go to `Nintendo 3DS\x\x\title\00040000\00175e00\data` (`x` being random letters/numbers).
8.  Copy the file in the folder to a safe location on your PC. Rename that copy `16.sav`. **Do not** rename, move, or delete the original file on your SD card.
9.  Move the six Pokémon from box 1 to box 2\. It is important that you preserve their order exactly.
10.  Save the game.
11.  Exit the game. There is no need to save twice this time. If you do, the process will fail.
12.  Browse to your save file on your SD card. Copy the file to a safe location on your PC. Rename that copy `165.sav`. Again, leave the original file on the SD card unaltered.
13.  In KeySAVe, go to the Breaking tab and open `16.sav` as `file 1` and `165.sav` as `file 2`. Click on `Break`. Your encryption key will be saved.

## Breaking more boxes

After the initial decryption, only the first six slots of boxes 1 and 2 will be decrypted. KeySAVe will automatically decrypt more slots as you dump saves, but to hasten the process, follow these steps:

*   Empty every box you want to unlock. Create a backup of this save.
*   Completely fill the boxes with any Pokémon (they do not have to be yours). Create a backup of this save.
*   Move the Pokémon around, so that each slot contains a different Pokémon than it did in the previous save. Create a backup of this save.
*   For each of the saves you created, open it in KeySAVe.

## Further uses

Once the initial breaking is completed, simply follow these instructions:

1.  Move the Pokémon to a decrypted slot or box.
2.  Save the game.
3.  Copy the save file onto your computer.
4.  On KeySAVe, using the Dumping tab, open your save file.
